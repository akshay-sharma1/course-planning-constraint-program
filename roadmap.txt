in-progress:

todo:
- enforce complex prerequisites (e.g. ECON 001 AND (STAT 101 OR STAT 102))
- user can request to take class in any semester
- handle courses missing across fall/spring
- change course requests to semester requirements (can maybe keep course requests api)
- logging
- write tests

done (reverse chrono):
- create a better system for double counting (+ reqs that can always double count)
- big refactor + types
- requirements can have nicknames
- enforce basic prerequisites (e.g. CIS 120, 160)
- limit on double counting
- user can request to take class in specified semester
- parallelize API requests
- cache API requests (to a local file)
